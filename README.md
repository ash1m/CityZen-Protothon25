Prototype built in Bolt as part of a weekend hackthon (spent 8 hours on this prototype).

Process:
The goal was to design smarter, more human-centered urban experiences— from navigation and public transport to safety, accessibility, and community engagement.

Based on the <a href="https://doc.clickup.com/26455927/p/h/t7bvq-4251/f677b716e286242/t7bvq-4491">brief</a>, I came up with the following target user profile-
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <h2>Citizen Type</h2>
      <p>
        * Newly moved in <br>
        * Living in an aparment building/gated community <br>
        * Living in a city <br>
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <h2>
        Goals of Citizen-
      </h2>
<p>
<h3> 1. Raise issue quickly </h3>
  Issue location <br>
  Nature of issue using AI <br>
  Record evidence easily (guidelines) <br>
  create a sense of urgency

<h3> 2. Escalate Issue to Community (level) </h3>
* Motivation (short text/video) <br>
* Language Translate (for newly moved in) <br>

<h3> 3. Escalate issue to Local Authority (Police, Mayor, Councilor) </h3>
* Written Complaint <br>
* Signed Petition <br>
* Status Update <br>

<h3> 4. Follow-up on issue (who to call) </h3>
</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Then I sketched some ideas in Figma
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3ced198-bf78-4b21-a916-0b6d71f6cf3e" alt="sketch01"></td>
<td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983e7422-0dc1-44bb-bc7e-7985ecc61ea9" alt="sketch02"></td>
<td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b40d8e78-4295-4d5d-9d96-1ac46a3b485d" alt="sketch3"></td>
</tr>
</table>

I fed these into Bolt to build the <a href="https://illustrious-yeot-4920fa.netlify.app/">prototype</a>.

---------------------------

For the presentation images, I fed this image to OpenAI and asked to point the patterns it can see in the image.
![Inspiration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16571c04-3b2d-4ca3-a8c0-97ee3daf8450)

Vivid Colors 
Cartoon/Illustrative Style
Repetition of Rounded Shapes
Emphasis on Human Expression
Inclusion of Art and Creativity

I used the generated images to come up with a gradient for the presentation background
