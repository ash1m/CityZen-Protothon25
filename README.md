# CityZen-Protothon25
Prototype built in Bolt as part of a weekend hackthon (spent 8 hours on this prototype).

Process:

The goal was to design smarter, more human-centered urban experiencesâ€” from navigation and public transport to safety, accessibility, and community engagement.

Based on the <a href="https://doc.clickup.com/26455927/p/h/t7bvq-4251/f677b716e286242/t7bvq-4491">brief</a>, I came up with the following target user profile-
<table>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <h2>Citizen Type</h2>
      <p>
        * Newly moved in
        * Living in an aparment building/gated community
        * Living in a city
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <h2>
        Goals of Citizen-
      </h2>
<p>
1. Raise issue quickly
    1. Issue location
    2. nature of issue using AI
    3. Record evidence easily (guidelines)
    4. create a sense of urgency

2. Escalate Issue to Community (level)
    * Motivation (short text/video)
    * Language Translate (for newly moved in)

3. Escalate issue to Local Authority (Police, Mayor, Councilor)
    * Written Complaint
    * Signed Petition
    * Status Update

4. Follow-up on issue (who to call)  
</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Then I sketched some ideas in Figma
