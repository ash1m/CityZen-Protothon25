The goal was to design smarter, more human-centered urban experiencesâ€” from navigation and public transport to safety, accessibility, and community engagement.

Based on the <a href="https://doc.clickup.com/26455927/p/h/t7bvq-4251/f677b716e286242/t7bvq-4491">brief</a>, I came up with the following target user profile-
<table width=100%>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <h2>Citizen Type</h2>
      <p>
        * Newly moved in <br>
        * Living in an aparment building/gated community <br>
        * Living in a city <br>
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <h2>
        Goals of Citizen-
      </h2>
<p>
1. Raise issue quickly <br>
    * Issue location <br>
    * nature of issue using AI <br>
    * Record evidence easily (guidelines) <br>
    * create a sense of urgency

2. Escalate Issue to Community (level) <br>

    * Language Translate (for newly moved in) <br>

3. Escalate issue to Local Authority (Police, Mayor, Councilor) <br>

4. Follow-up on issue (who to call) <br>

Then I sketched some ideas in Figma
